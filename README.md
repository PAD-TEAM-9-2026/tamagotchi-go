# Tamagotchi Go

Shared backend for virtual pet apps. Different frontend packages ship their own
creatures, art and care rules, and all of them run on these eight services.


## Team

| Member | Services | Language |
|---|---|---|
| Patricia | User Management, Battle | C#, ASP.NET Core |
| Victoria | Tamagotchi, Notification | TypeScript, Node.js |
| Mihaela | Guild, Package Registry | TypeScript, Node.js |
| Sergiu | Map, Monster Raid | C#, ASP.NET Core |


## Repository

Each service has its own private repository. Only the professor is invited to
them, not teammates. They are linked here as submodules.

| Service | Submodule path | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| User Management | `services/user-management` | Patricia |
| Battle | `services/battle` | Patricia |
| Tamagotchi | `services/tamagotchi` | Victoria |
| Notification | `services/notifications` | Victoria |
| Guild | `services/guild` | Mihaela |
| Package Registry | `services/package-registry` | Mihaela |
| Map | `services/map` | Sergiu |
| Monster Raid | `services/monster-raid` | Sergiu |

## Service boundaries

Each service owns one part of the game and one database. Nothing reads another
service's tables.

| Service | Owns | Does not own |
|---|---|---|
| User Management | Accounts, login, JWT issuing, friends, enemies, global and local currency, which packages a user joined | Anything about creatures or battles |
| Tamagotchi | Creatures, origin owner, holder set, primary and secondary role, combat type, level, XP, raw package stats | Damage, battle outcome, what the stats mean |
| Battle | Challenges, turns, damage, who won, XP split, access grant decision | Creature state, currency balances |
| Guild | Guilds, members, roles, invitations, chat | User identity, raid state |
| Package Registry | Packages, stat definitions, bonus rules, starter config, assets, bosses, raid schedule | User data, live raids |
| Map | Latest locations, freshness, who is nearby | Friend lists, battles |
| Monster Raid | Live raids, boss HP, attacks, damage per player, rewards | Boss definitions, guild membership |
| Notification | Devices, push tokens, delivery, history, mute settings | Every domain decision, message text |

Two rules keep the boundaries honest. Battle decides, Tamagotchi applies.
Package Registry holds configuration, the runtime services hold state.

A third rule follows from the shared-access model described below: a creature is
never moved, only shared. No service transfers ownership, and no service deletes
a creature as the result of a battle.

## Shared access

Winning a battle does not take the loser's creature away. It adds the winner to
that creature's **holder set**. There is still exactly one creature row, with one
level, one XP total and one set of package stats, and every holder sees the same
values. Nothing is split, because nothing is copied.

| Concept | Rule |
|---|---|
| `origin_owner_id` | The user the creature was minted for. Immutable, never changes for any reason |
| `holder_user_ids` | Everyone who may use, care for and select the creature. Contains the origin owner from the moment it is minted |
| Holder cap | **5.** A win against a creature that already has five holders grants global currency instead of access |
| Spread | Access is granted only to the winner of a battle the creature was staked in. It is never revoked, and holders cannot grant it to anyone else |
| Dropping access | A holder may remove themselves. The origin owner may not, so a creature always has at least one holder |
| Care | Any holder may run care actions. There is one hunger value and everyone shares the consequences |
| Primary selection | Per user, and it may point at any creature the user holds. The same creature may be the primary of several users at once |

The cap is what keeps a win meaningful. Without it every creature drifts toward
being held by everyone and the stake disappears; five is high enough that sharing
still spreads and low enough that a strong creature stays worth fighting for.

Shared care is deliberately unguarded. A co-holder can let a shared creature go
hungry, and that is part of the mechanic rather than an oversight.

**One battle at a time.** A creature is exclusive while it fights: it can be in
at most one battle or raid, and a second attempt to field it is refused with
`409 creature_engaged`. Because a creature can now have five holders, three rules
stop that lock from becoming a way to grief the others:

- The lock is taken at `accept`, not when the challenge is created, so an unanswered challenge never blocks anyone.
- A challenge expires after 2 minutes unaccepted, and an accepted battle auto-forfeits after its turn timer runs out, so a disconnected player cannot hold a shared creature forever.
- A user may hold at most one pending challenge per creature, so one holder cannot queue several and occupy it by rotation.

**No last-creature case.** Because a battle never removes a creature from anyone,
a collection cannot be emptied by losing. The only way to end up with nothing is
to drop access to everything, which the origin owner cannot do for their own
creature. The rejoin path and its 24 hour cooldown existed only to repair a
collection emptied by loss, and both are gone.

## Architecture

![Tamagotchi Go architecture — 8 microservices, PostgreSQL per service, RabbitMQ event bus](docs/img/architecture_diagram.png)

Every client goes through the HTTP Gateway. It routes by path prefix to the eight
services, so a frontend package never learns where a service lives or how many
replicas answer.

The dashed box holds the services themselves. Each one owns a single database on
a shared PostgreSQL server, with its own user and grants, so there is no
cross-service SQL. When a service needs something it does not own, it asks the
owner over HTTP: Battle reserves pets, writes XP and grants access through
Tamagotchi, Monster
Raid checks guild membership with Guild, Map resolves relationships through User
Management, and everyone reads combat rules, stat definitions and starter config
from Package Registry. Those calls are synchronous because the caller cannot
continue without the answer.

Everything that already happened goes on the bus instead. All seven domain
services publish committed facts to RabbitMQ, and the consumers decide what
matters to them. Notification is the largest one: it turns those facts into
delivery fan-out and pushes to phones through Firebase Cloud Messaging, without
any publisher knowing it exists. Registry also keeps a membership projection
from User Management events, so package eligibility checks stay local.

The one edge drawn in red is the exception to the usual flow: the membership
projection rebuild between User Management and Registry, used to repair that
copy when it drifts.

## Technologies

| Service | Stack | Database | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| User Management | C#, ASP.NET Core | PostgreSQL | Money and identity need strict typing and real transactions |
| Battle | C#, ASP.NET Core | PostgreSQL | Turn state and settlement retries, same reason |
| Tamagotchi | TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Zod | PostgreSQL | Mostly reads and writes rows; JSONB stores package stats with no fixed shape |
| Notification | TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Firebase Admin | PostgreSQL | Waits on the network, never computes |
| Guild | TypeScript, Node.js, Express, WebSocket | PostgreSQL | Chat needs many open connections |
| Package Registry | TypeScript, Node.js, Express| PostgreSQL | Config documents differ per package |
| Map | C#, ASP.NET Core, EF Core | PostgreSQL with PostGIS | Distance queries need a spatial index |
| Monster Raid | C#, ASP.NET Core, EF Core | PostgreSQL | Counters under concurrent attacks |

Two languages, as the lab requires. TypeScript for the four services that mostly
move JSON around, C# for the four that hold money, turns, counters and
coordinates.

Trade-offs we accepted:

- Node is slower at CPU work. None of these four services do CPU work.
- C# is more code for a small CRUD endpoint. It pays off where a wrong number is a bug a player can see.
- One PostgreSQL engine everywhere, so one thing to learn and one Compose service. PostGIS is an extension, not a second database.

## Communication patterns

How services talk:

| Interaction | Shape | Technology | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Request and response | One to one, synchronous, the caller waits | HTTP, JSON | Client to gateway, and service to service when the answer is needed now |
| Publish and subscribe | One to many, asynchronous | RabbitMQ topic exchanges | Announcing something that already happened |
| Bidirectional stream | One to one, asynchronous, both sides send | WebSocket | Guild chat |
| One way notification | One to one, asynchronous, through a third party | Firebase Cloud Messaging | Push to a phone that is not running the app |

A battle cannot start without the participants, so that call is synchronous. A
granted access is a fact, not a request, so it is an event and the publisher does
not need to know who reacts.

Named patterns we use:

| Pattern | Where |
|---|---|
| API Gateway | One entry point, routes by service prefix, handles auth and correlation IDs |
| Database per Service | Eight databases, separate credentials |
| Transactional Outbox | Every publisher, so a state change and its event commit together |
| Idempotent Consumer | Every consumer, dedupe on `event_id` |
| Dead Letter Channel | Three attempts, then the message parks for the owner to replay |
| Competing Consumers | Replicas of one service share its work queue |
| Correlation Identifier | One ID follows a battle through HTTP, the broker and the push |
| Optimistic Offline Lock | `ETag` and `If-Match` on edits |


## Data management

One database per service. Separate credentials, so a service cannot read another
service's tables even by accident. In development all eight run as separate
schemas in one PostgreSQL container, each with its own user and grants.

What it costs, and what we do instead:

| Cost | Answer |
|---|---|
| No joins across services | Two calls and a join in the caller |
| No foreign keys across services | Events clean up, for example a deleted user |
| No distributed transactions | Outbox at the publisher, dedupe at the consumer |

Consistency is ACID inside a service and eventual between services. Three
mechanisms carry it:

- **Outbox.** A state change and its event commit in one transaction. A poller publishes the row after commit, so nothing is announced for work that rolled back.
- **Idempotency-Key.** Required on every command that is not naturally repeatable. A retry after a timeout does not double an award.
- **Consumer dedupe.** Every consumer stores `event_id` under a unique constraint, so at-least-once delivery becomes one effect.

## Communication contract

### Conventions

| Concern | Rule |
|---|---|
| Gateway routing | `/{service}/v1/...`, the prefix is stripped before the service sees it |
| Payload | JSON, UTF-8, snake_case |
| IDs | UUID v7, string encoded |
| Timestamps | ISO 8601, UTC, milliseconds |
| Errors | RFC 9457, `application/problem+json` |
| Pagination | Opaque cursor, never an offset |
| Concurrency | `ETag` on reads, `If-Match` on writes, 412 on mismatch |
| Idempotency | `Idempotency-Key` header on non-repeatable commands |
| Auth, user | JWT from User Management, verified against a cached JWKS |
| Auth, service | Internal JWT with a `scope` claim, never given to clients |
| Correlation | `X-Correlation-Id` from the gateway, passed on and copied into events |

The tables below name the request and response shape of every endpoint. Each
shape is listed field by field, with types and which fields are required, in
[field-types.md](docs/field-types.md).

Every service also exposes `GET /health` and `GET /ready`, returning 200 or 503.

Joining a package grants that package's starter once per user per package, and
that is the only path by which a creature is minted for a player. There is no
rejoin path, no starter regrant and no cooldown: since a battle never empties a
collection, none of that has anything left to repair.

`POST /v1/internal/battle-settlements` moves global currency only. The creature
side of a battle is settled by Battle calling Tamagotchi, and this service is
never told which creature was staked.

A win against a creature that has already reached the holder cap is compensated
here instead, as a global currency credit with reason `BATTLE_ACCESS_CAP`.

### Tamagotchi, `/tamagotchi`

| Method and path | Request | Response | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/tamagotchis` | Mint, Idempotency-Key | 201 Tamagotchi | service |
| `GET /v1/tamagotchis/{id}` | none | 200 Tamagotchi | user or service |

| `PUT /v1/users/{userId}/collection/primary` | PrimaryInput, If-Match | 200 PrimarySelection | user |

| `POST /v1/internal/engagements` | EngagementInput, Idempotency-Key | 201 Engagement | service |
| `GET /v1/internal/engagements/{battleId}` | none | 200 Engagement | service |
| `POST /v1/internal/engagements/{battleId}/release` | Idempotency-Key | 200 Engagement | service |

`package_stats` is stored as it arrives and returned as stored. This service
never reads inside it. Package Registry owns what the fields mean.

`POST /holders` is the only way the holder set grows, it is called by Battle at
settlement, and it is idempotent in three directions: a repeat with the same
`Idempotency-Key` returns the first receipt, a grant to someone who already holds
the creature returns `ALREADY_HOLDER` and changes nothing, and a grant to a
creature at the cap of five returns `CAP_REACHED` and changes nothing. Battle
reads that outcome and credits currency instead when the cap was reached.

`DELETE /holders/{userId}` lets a holder drop a creature they no longer want. A
user may only remove themselves, and the request is refused with `409` when the
caller is the creature's `origin_owner_id`, so every creature keeps at least one
holder and no creature is ever orphaned.

`role` in a `Tamagotchi` response is relative to the user the request is made
for, because primary is a per-user selection. The same creature comes back as
`PRIMARY` for one holder and `SECONDARY` for another, and `GET /collection`
splits it accordingly.

Level is global. One XP table lives here, and a package decides how much XP its
care actions award, never what a level is worth. `sprite_ref` is a logical id,
resolved by the client through Package Registry's public asset manifest, so a
creature shared across packages still renders.

**Engagements.** `POST /internal/engagements` is the exclusive lock described in
[Shared access](#shared-access). Battle calls it when a challenge is accepted,
not when it is created, and it reserves all four creatures of both lineups at
once. If any of them is already engaged the whole call is refused with
`409 creature_engaged` and nothing is reserved, so a battle never starts
half-locked. An engagement carries an `expires_at`; once it passes, the lock is
released by the owner even if Battle never called `/release`, so a crashed battle
cannot strand a shared creature.

Monster Raid takes the same lock for a primary contributed to a raid, which is
why a creature cannot be in a raid and a battle at the same time.

### Battle, `/battle`

| Method and path | Request | Response | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/battles` | BattleInput, Idempotency-Key | 201 Battle | user |
| `GET /v1/battles` | query limit, cursor | 200 BattlePage | user |
| `GET /v1/battles/{battleId}` | none | 200 Battle | user |
| `POST /v1/battles/{battleId}/accept` | BattleAccept, Idempotency-Key | 202 Battle | user |
| `POST /v1/battles/{battleId}/reject` | Idempotency-Key | 200 Battle | user |
| `POST /v1/battles/{battleId}/attack` | ActorInput, Idempotency-Key | 200 BattleAttack | user |
| `POST /v1/battles/{battleId}/forfeit` | Idempotency-Key | 200 Battle | user |

**What is at stake.** Each side names its `primary_id` and `secondary_id` when
challenging or accepting, and the primary is the creature at stake. Both are
validated against the caller's holder set, so a player may field any creature
they hold, including one they won from someone else. A creature is not refused
for being shared with the opponent already, but a grant to a user who is already
a holder is a no-op, so nothing is gained by fighting for one twice.

**Settlement is three calls and one event.** Battle credits the winner and debits
the loser through User Management, writes the XP split through Tamagotchi at
60/40 between primary and secondary, and calls `POST /tamagotchis/{id}/holders`
to add the winner to the loser's primary. If that grant comes back `CAP_REACHED`,
Battle credits the winner global currency with reason `BATTLE_ACCESS_CAP`
instead. `settlement_status` and `access_grant_status` on the battle track the
two halves separately, since either can be retried alone.

**Timers.** A challenge expires 2 minutes after creation if it is not accepted,
and an accepted battle whose turn timer runs out is auto-forfeited. Both exist to
release the engagement lock, and both are enforced here rather than in Tamagotchi
because Battle owns the turn state.

### Guild, `/guild`

| Method and path | Request | Response | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/guilds` | GuildInput, Idempotency-Key | 201 Guild | user |
| `GET /v1/guilds` | query limit, cursor | 200 GuildPage | user |
| `GET /v1/guilds/{guildId}` | none | 200 Guild | user or service |
| `GET /v1/guilds/{guildId}/members` | none | 200 Members | user or service |
| `POST /v1/guilds/{guildId}/invitations` | InvitationInput, Idempotency-Key | 201 Invitation | user |
| `GET /v1/invitations` | query limit, cursor | 200 InvitationPage | user |
| `POST /v1/guilds/{guildId}/invitations/{id}/accept` | Idempotency-Key | 200 Invitation | user |
| `POST /v1/guilds/{guildId}/invitations/{id}/decline` | Idempotency-Key | 200 Invitation | user |
| `POST /v1/guilds/{guildId}/invitations/{id}/revoke` | Idempotency-Key | 200 Invitation | user |
| `DELETE /v1/guilds/{guildId}/members/{userId}` | none | 204 | user |
| `PATCH /v1/guilds/{guildId}/members/{userId}/role` | RoleInput, Idempotency-Key | 200 Members | user |
| `POST /v1/guilds/{guildId}/leadership` | LeaderInput, Idempotency-Key | 200 Guild | user |
| `DELETE /v1/guilds/{guildId}` | none | 204 | user |
| `GET /v1/guilds/{guildId}/messages` | query limit, cursor | 200 ChatPage | user |
| `GET /v1/guilds/{guildId}/chat` | WebSocket upgrade | 101 | user |

Chat token goes in the handshake header, never the query string. The `Ws`
shapes in [field-types.md](docs/field-types.md) are the frames sent over the socket.

Guild calls User Management for user identity and relationships, and Package
Registry only for package eligibility. The topic text points at Registry Service
for identity checks, which is a wording error: User Management is the authority
on who a user is and who they are friends with.

### Package Registry, `/registry`

| Method and path | Request | Response | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/packages` | PackageInput, Idempotency-Key | 201 Package | admin |
| `GET /v1/packages` | query limit, cursor | 200 PackagePage | public |
| `GET /v1/packages/{packageId}` | none | 200 Package | public |
| `PATCH /v1/packages/{packageId}` | PackageEdit, If-Match | 200 Package | moderator |
| `PUT /v1/packages/{packageId}/stats` | PackageConfigWrite, Idempotency-Key | 200 PackageConfig | moderator |
| `GET /v1/packages/{packageId}/stat-definitions` | query config_version | 200 StatDefinitions | service |
| `GET /v1/packages/{packageId}/stat-bonuses` | query config_version | 200 Bonuses | service |
| `GET /v1/packages/{packageId}/currency-rules` | query config_version | 200 CurrencyRules | service |
| `GET /v1/packages/{packageId}/starter-pet` | query config_version | 200 StarterConfig | service |
| `GET /v1/packages/{packageId}/assets` | query config_version | 200 Assets | public |
| `GET /v1/packages/{packageId}/users` | query limit, cursor | 200 PackageMemberPage | service |
| `POST /v1/packages/eligibility-check` | EligibilityInput | 200 Eligibility | service |
| `POST /v1/bosses` | BossInput, Idempotency-Key | 201 Boss | admin |
| `GET /v1/bosses` | query limit, cursor | 200 BossPage | admin |
| `GET /v1/bosses/{bossId}` | query config_version | 200 Boss | admin or service |
| `PUT /v1/bosses/{bossId}` | BossInput, If-Match | 200 Boss | admin |
| `POST /v1/raid-occurrences` | OccurrenceInput, Idempotency-Key | 201 Occurrence | admin |
| `GET /v1/raid-occurrences` | query limit, cursor | 200 OccurrencePage | user |
| `GET /v1/raid-occurrences/{id}` | none | 200 Occurrence | user or service |
| `POST /v1/raid-occurrences/{id}/activate` | Idempotency-Key | 200 OccurrenceReceipt | admin |
| `POST /v1/raid-occurrences/{id}/deactivate` | Idempotency-Key | 200 OccurrenceReceipt | admin |
| `POST /v1/raid-occurrences/{id}/cancel` | Idempotency-Key | 200 OccurrenceReceipt | admin |

Packages are abstract to this backend. A package defines its own creatures, art
and care rules in its own frontend, and nothing here knows what `hunger` or
`discipline` is supposed to mean. What Registry stores is a *declaration*: a
`StatDefinition` gives a key a type and bounds so a value can be validated, and a
`BonusRule` is a generic comparison — stat key, operator, threshold, effect,
value in basis points. Battle evaluates those rules mechanically against the
creature's `package_stats` without interpreting any of them, which is how a
package-specific bonus applies without any service sharing the package's data
model.

### Map, `/map`

| Method and path | Request | Response | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/location` | LocationInput, Idempotency-Key | 200 LocationReceipt | user |
| `GET /v1/location/nearby/{userId}` | query limit, cursor | 200 Nearby | user |

Friends and enemies are visible while their location is fresh. Strangers appear
within 6 metres, which is configurable.

### Monster Raid, `/raid`

| Method and path | Request | Response | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/raids` | RaidInput, Idempotency-Key | 201 Raid | user |
| `GET /v1/raids` | query guild_id, limit, cursor | 200 RaidPage | user |
| `GET /v1/raids/{raidId}` | none | 200 Raid | user or service |
| `POST /v1/raids/{raidId}/attack` | ActorInput, Idempotency-Key | 200 RaidAttack | user |
| `GET /v1/raids/{raidId}/leaderboard` | query limit, cursor | 200 Leaderboard | user or service |

A member contributes their primary, which is reserved through the same
`POST /internal/engagements` lock Battle uses, so a creature cannot fight a boss
and a player at once. A shared creature may be contributed by whichever holder
fields it first; the others get `409 creature_engaged` until the raid ends.

Push carries a type and parameters, never a finished sentence. Each package
renders and translates its own text, so one wording is not forced on every
frontend.

```json

  "token": "fH9k...",

### Events

Seven durable topic exchanges, one per publisher. Notification publishes
nothing. Each event payload is an `...Event` shape in
[field-types.md](docs/field-types.md).

| Routing key | Publisher | Consumer | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user.package_joined.v1` | User Management | Tamagotchi, Package Registry | Grant the package starter if the user has none for it. Update the membership projection |
| `user.friend_request_created.v1` | User Management | Notification | FRIEND_REQUEST |
| `tamagotchi.created.v1` | Tamagotchi | audit | A creature was minted |
| `tamagotchi.access_granted.v1` | Tamagotchi | Notification | TAMAGOTCHI_SHARED, sent to every holder the creature already had |
| `tamagotchi.leveled_up.v1` | Tamagotchi | audit | Level threshold crossed |
| `battle.request_created.v1` | Battle | Notification | BATTLE_REQUEST |
| `battle.completed.v1` | Battle | audit | Battle resolved |
| `guild.invitation_created.v1` | Guild | Notification | GUILD_INVITATION |
| `guild.member_joined.v1` | Guild | audit | Invitation accepted |
| `guild.member_left.v1` | Guild | audit | Kicked or left |
| `registry.occurrence_changed.v1` | Package Registry | Monster Raid | Raid schedule changed |
| `map.proximity_detected.v1` | Map | Notification | PLAYER_NEARBY, both users |
| `raid.started.v1` | Monster Raid | Notification | RAID_STARTED, recipients carried in the event |
| `raid.completed.v1` | Monster Raid | audit | Boss died or the timer ran out |

Each consumer has a work queue, two retry queues at 5 s and 30 s, and a dead
letter queue. Three attempts, then the message parks in the DLQ and the owner
replays it with the same event ID.

## GitHub workflow

Branches: `main` is the release branch, `develop` is the integration branch.
Work branches start from `develop` and are named `type/short-description`,
using `feat`, `fix`, `docs` or `chore`, for example `docs/contract-readme`.
Commits follow Conventional Commits, `type(scope): description`, for example
`docs(contract): add endpoint tables`.

Both shared branches are protected. No direct pushes, no force pushes. A PR
needs one approval from someone who did not write it and all conversations
resolved. Approvals are dismissed when new commits arrive. A change to a
contract also needs the affected consumers to review it.

Merging: feature into `develop` by squash. `develop` into `main` by
merge commit, so the shared history stays intact.

A PR says what changed and why, links its issue, lists affected services, shows
any contract diff and says how it was checked. The template is in
`.github/pull_request_template.md`.

Versioning: each lab is a release. Nothing merges into `main` before the lab is
presented. After the presentation `develop` merges into `main` and `main` is
tagged with a new version, `v0.1.0` for Lab 0, `v1.0.0` for Lab 1 and so on.
The private service repositories follow the same rule and carry their own tags.

Testing: Lab 0 checks documents, schemas and links with
`python3 tools/check_contracts.py`. From Lab 1, unit tests for domain rules,
transaction tests against a real PostgreSQL and consumer tests against the event
schemas. Target 80 % line coverage in domain code, and concurrency, idempotency
and recovery paths covered regardless of the number.

Nobody commits `.env` files, API keys, `node_modules` or build output. Each
service ships a `.env.example` with empty values.

## Service documents

Each private repository README repeats its own endpoints, events and dependencies, so the
service can be read on its own.
